C.R.A.SSH 
=========
C.R.A.SSH (*crassh*) stands for *Cisco Remote Automation via SSH*, it is a python script for automating commands on Cisco devices.

|build-status| |docs|

Crassh can be used in two ways: 

* a stand alone script that users (*Network Admins*) can run to perform actions on Cisco devices
* a module developers can import and leverage in their own scripts

The  **documentation is available here:** http://crassh.readthedocs.org

My `personal blog`_ contains a `tutorial here`_ on how to use crassh in standalone mode and an `initial example`_ on how to use the crassh module. Future `news about crassh can be found here`_.
